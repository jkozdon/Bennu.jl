# Bennu ð“…£

Bennu is a toolbox for discontinuous spectral element discretizations of partial
differential equations that supports execution on either the CPU or GPU (via
[KernelAbstractions](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl)).

See [Atum](https://github.com/mwarusz/Atum.jl) for examples using Bennu to solve
balance laws.
